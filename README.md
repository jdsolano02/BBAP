## 📖 Project Overview

**BBAP (Bloom Battle Amateur Practice)** is a web application designed to assist baristas and coffee enthusiasts in training for the **2024 Bloom Battle Amateur** competition (hosted at Casa Pinto, Costa Rica).

* **Recipe Management:** User interface for logging critical extraction variables (Dose, Ratio, Time, Temperature).
* **Ratio Calculator:** Automated math logic to ensure brewing consistency.
* **Responsive Design:** Fully accessible on mobile devices for direct use at the coffee bar.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This project was built with a focus on performance and vanilla DOM manipulation:

* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## 💡 Project Background

As a specialty coffee enthusiast and competitor, I identified that tracking practice brews on paper was inefficient. I developed this tool to optimize my workflow and help fellow competitors leading up to the event on November 16th at Casa Pinto.
